        <h2>Author logs</h2>
        <p>
          Authors create and update documents by publishing operations. Each author has
          their own operation log associated with a document. Depending on the pruning logic for the
          document, an authors log will be trimmed or even completely removed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The authors in this document are "anna" (owner), "billy" and "claire". They are peers on
          the network and send messages to each other containing any changes they make. They do
          this at different <i>frequencies</i> and the messages are delayed by network
          <i>latency</i>. High latency and frequent changes will result in concurrent changes
          occurring more often. Sometimes peers may go offline entirely, but keep editing their
          document locally.

      <h2>Document</h2>

      <p>
        A document "window" bounds the set of operations which make up it's current history. It's
        possible to keep a documents entire history of changes, or only the most recent. The size of
        the window is determined by the documents' pruning strategy. Below are three basic
        parameters for configuring when operations should be pruned, by depth (distance from tip) or
        by timestamp. There is the possibility to introduce custom pruning algorithms which could have
        application specific logic.
      </p>

      <h2>Capabilities</h2>

      <p>
        Initially only a documents owner (creator) is authorized to perform any actions (read, write,
        delete) on it. When collaboration is desired, the owner can issue tokens (aka
        capabilities) which state <i>who</i> can perform <i>what</i> actions <i>when</i>. The
        current document is owned by <b>anna</b>, we can simulate issuing capabilities over time
        ranges here. Type the name ("billy" or "claire") of the author you want to issue the
        capability to, and state how long it should be valid.
